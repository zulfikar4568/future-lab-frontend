        <h3>Mentee-Mentor Communication Using the FutureLab Service</h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of FutureLab is to allow registered Mentors to
          provide Mentees with mentoring services that Mentees need. FutureLab
          hosts live conversations, email exchanges and scheduling between
          Mentees and Mentors through its web site. In the process, FutureLab
          does not disclose the phone numbers, email addresses or full names of
          its users, nor do we share this information among interacting Mentors
          and Mentees. FutureLab does not screen or edit the content of
          communications between Mentees and Mentors. Such communications are
          personal and private unless both parties agree to additional
          distribution. FutureLab keeps information relayed between the Mentee
          and the Mentor confidential. No other users of FutureLab have access
          to this information.
